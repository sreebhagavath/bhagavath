         <p>For hundreds of years, Tarot cards have been used as a tool for divination, and a way to cast light on life's questions and challenges. Contrary to popular belief, anyone can read the Tarot. You don't need to be psychic or spend years training, as the images on the cards are powerful and universal.Tarot decks did not come before decks having four suits of the same length. They were invented not for occult purposes but purely for gaming. In 1781, Court de GÃ©belin published an essay associating the cards with ancient wisdom. This idea was later disproved by Dummett. Tarot cards have been used for cartomancy and divination as well as gaming. Nowadays fortune-tellers tend to use specially-developed tarot decks rather than those used for games. Not just the cards but now there are several websites available online where people go to get their answers. They simply put the data on the lucky wheel and it starts spinning. When it stops, the people know what's written in the cards for them.</p>
